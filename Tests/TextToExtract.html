<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    <a title='BoofCV Website' href='http:/boofcv.org/'>BoofCV</a> is a new real time
    computer vision library written in Java.&nbsp; Written from scratch for ease of
    use and high performance, it provides a range of functionality from low level image
    processing, wavelet denoising, to higher level 3D geometric vision. Released under
    an Apache license for both academic and commercial use. BoofCV's speed has been
    demonstrated in a couple of comparative studies against other popular computer vision
    libraries (<a title='Performance' href='http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Performance:BoofCV'>link</a>).
</p>
<p>
    To demonstrate BoofCV's API, an example of how to associate point features between
    two images is shown below.&nbsp; Image association is a vital component in creating
    image mosaics, image stabilization, visual odometry, 3D structure estimation, and
    many other applications.

<p>
    BoofCV's website contains numerious examples and several tutorials.&nbsp; You can
    run a multitude of Java Applets in your webbrowser to see its features before installing.
    BoofCV also has a youtube channel explaining different concepts and examples.
